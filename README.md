- **Endpoint Testing**: Ensure robust backend performance with comprehensive testing for all API endpoints.  
- **Component Optimization**: Refactor React components for better reusability, readability, and performance.  
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Validate the entire user journey to identify and fix potential usability issues.  
- **UX Improvements**: Enhance user experience with intuitive design updates and accessibility considerations.
